# The Random Batch Method in Linear Quadratic Optimal Control
A Matlab implementation of the Random Batch Method (RBM) in Linear Quadratic (LQ) optimal control problems. 
The examples are the same as the ones as in [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-022-01290-3). 
More information can be found in the posts [here]() and [here](). 

### Main features
* A gradient-based solver for optimal control problems constrained by Random Batch Dynamics. 
* Plotting of the obtained optimal controls and state trajectories.

### Considered examples
* Example 1:
